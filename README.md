### 🔗 Smart Contracts & Enterprise Integration

This repository contains the **On-Chain logic** for the project—a robust Proof of Concept (PoC) designed to demonstrate seamless integration between **Java Enterprise (Jakarta EE)** systems and **Blockchain technology**.

---

## 🏛️ System Architecture

The project follows a **Hybrid Architecture** to bridge the gap between traditional enterprise logic and decentralized immutability.

| Layer | Component | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **On-Chain** | Smart Contracts | **Solidity** | Manages immutability, ownership, and asset transfers (NFTs/RWAs) via ERC-1155. |
| **Off-Chain** | Middleware | **Java Enterprise** | Acts as the central orchestrator for business logic and secure communication via **Web3j**. |
